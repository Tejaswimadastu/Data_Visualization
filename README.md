Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
Overview

Data visualization is a critical step in data analysis, helping to explore, understand, and communicate patterns, trends, and relationships in datasets. Python provides powerful libraries for visualization, with Matplotlib and Seaborn being among the most widely used.

1. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a versatile and low-level plotting library that provides detailed control over every element of a plot. It can be used to create a wide range of visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

Key Features

Highly customizable plots including colors, labels, ticks, and legends

Ability to create multiple subplots in a single figure

Integration with NumPy and Pandas for handling data

Supports exporting plots to various formats such as PNG, PDF, and SVG

Use Case: Matplotlib is ideal when fine-grained control is needed, or when creating highly customized visualizations for presentations or publications.

2. Seaborn

Seaborn is a high-level statistical visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It simplifies the creation of attractive and informative visualizations, especially for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Key Features

Provides aesthetically pleasing default styles and color palettes

Simplifies visualization of statistical relationships between variables

Supports relational, categorical, and distribution plots

Works seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames for direct plotting of columns

Use Case: Seaborn is ideal for quickly generating informative statistical graphics, exploring patterns, relationships, and distributions in datasets with minimal code.
